<h1>Constructors</h1>
- A constructor is the base method which gets called when you instancate an instance of a class
- An emtpy constructor is a constructor without parameters
- You can have multiple constructors with different parameters
- If you do not create a constructor for your class, the compiler will do it for you
- A constructor can invocate another constructor meaning they can refer to values.

<h2>Multiple constructors</h2>
With multiple constructors we always start with most amount of parameters to allow our selvs to be able to perform invocation. <br>

Invocation between constructors can be seen in the "Instructor.java" class.
