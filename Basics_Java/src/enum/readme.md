<h1>Enums</h1>
- Not extendible
- Not instantiable 

- It is simply a class with a fixed set of constants
- It contains full-blown objects
- Constants -> static & finals
- Same naming conventions as constants
- Elements, members or enumerators of type


<h2>The important rule</h2>

Item 30: Use enums instead of int constants
