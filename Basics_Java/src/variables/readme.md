<h1>Variables</h1>
- Variables are simply containers

- You can get them and set them and also manipulate them as long as they are not final.
- They cannot appear on class level
- All variables have a datatype

- Variables can both be simple datatypes like, string, int aswell as complicated objects.


<h2>Primitive types</h2>
The 8 primitive types in Java are
1. boolean <br>
2. byte	<br>
3. short <br>
4. int <br>
5. long <br>
6. float <br>
7. double <br>
8. char <br>

<h2>Integers</h2>
- byte: 8 bit <br>
- short: 16 bits <br>
- int: 32 bits <br>
- long 64 bits <br>


<h2>Variable type casting</h2>
- Only numeric-numeric casting is possible
- Cannot cast to boolean or vice versa
- variable casting can be both Implicit or explicit

<h3>Implicit Casting</h3>
- Smaller to larger --> widening conversion <br>
- Integer to Floating-point is implicit casting <br>

<h3>Explicit Casting</h3>
- Larger to smaller --> narrowing conversion <br>

<h1>Reference types</h1>
- Reference types are types that refere to something. 
- When you initialize an instance of a student object, you are creating a reference type.
- Objects are stored in the heap in the memory.
